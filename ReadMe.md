# React Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio utilizes React and is split into smaller components for easier usage and easier to add features. Inside, you will find an about me page, a few of my projects, an area to contact me, and my resume. It is not complete yet and is in need of media queries, I need to update some display of images and texts, and add emailjs for the 'Contact Me' page to work properly. 

This is a new deployment with very limited commits. I was having issues with deployemnt with my original protfolio and the only solution I was able to find was to clone the work into a new repository. 

To se my previous work please go to : https://github.com/AliCelikay/hw_20 for the original repository.
